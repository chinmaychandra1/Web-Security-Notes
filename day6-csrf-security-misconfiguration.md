# Day 6 – CSRF & Security Misconfiguration (Web Security)

## What is CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)?
CSRF is a web security vulnerability that forces an authenticated user to perform unwanted actions on a web application without their knowledge or consent.
It works because browsers automatically include cookies with requests to a website.

---

## How CSRF Works (High-Level)
1. Victim is logged into a vulnerable website
2. Victim visits a malicious website or clicks a crafted link
3. Malicious site sends a request to the vulnerable application
4. Browser automatically includes session cookies
5. Application processes the request as if it came from the victim

The attacker never sees the response but still succeeds in performing the action.

---

## Why CSRF Occurs
- Application relies only on cookies for authentication
- No CSRF token or improper token validation
- Missing origin or referer validation
- Misconfigured SameSite cookie attributes

At its core, CSRF happens due to lack of request authenticity verification.

---

## CSRF Tokens
A CSRF token is a unique, unpredictable value generated by the server and tied to the user session.
It is included in sensitive requests and verified by the server.

If the token is missing or invalid, the request should be rejected.

---

## Common CSRF Defenses
- CSRF tokens (synchronizer tokens)
- SameSite cookie attribute
- Origin and Referer header validation
- Re-authentication for sensitive actions

Using multiple defenses together provides stronger protection.

---

## Common CSRF Weaknesses
- Missing CSRF token
- Token not tied to user session
- Token reused across requests
- CSRF protection only on some endpoints

These weaknesses can allow attackers to bypass CSRF defenses.

---

## What is Security Misconfiguration?
Security misconfiguration occurs when an application, server, or service is configured insecurely,
exposing sensitive information or functionality.

It is one of the most common and easily exploitable vulnerability categories.

---

## Common Security Misconfiguration Examples
- Default credentials enabled
- Debug or development mode enabled in production
- Directory listing enabled
- Exposed admin or management interfaces
- Unnecessary services running
- Verbose error messages revealing internal details

Misconfiguration often results from improper deployment or maintenance.

---

## Bug Bounty Relevance
- CSRF can lead to account takeover or unauthorized actions
- Misconfiguration often results in easy, high-impact findings
- Low technical complexity but high business impact
- Frequently rewarded vulnerabilities

Both issues are common in real-world applications.

---

## GSoC / Open Source Relevance
- Implementing CSRF protections is a core backend security task
- Secure configuration is critical for production-ready software
- Many open-source projects need improvements in default security settings
- Security hardening and configuration audits are common project goals

Understanding these topics helps build secure systems and tools.

---

## Day 6 Summary
- Understood CSRF and its attack flow
- Learned how CSRF tokens and defenses work
- Studied common security misconfiguration issues
- Developed a real-world security testing mindset

## Lab Observations (To Be Added Later)
<!--
ADD THIS SECTION LATER:

For CSRF labs, include:
- Affected endpoint
- Missing or weak defense
- Why the request was accepted
- Potential impact

Add this section during revision or portfolio polishing.
